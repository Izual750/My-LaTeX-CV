# My-LaTeX-CV
Just my CV/Resume, nothing more nothing less :)

If you want to build it, just run build.sh, you will need texlive.

Note: You can export these variables to get it a little bit more conveniant to use:
```
export __CV_ADDRESS '1 st. of Foo'
export __CV_CITY 'Bar'
export __CV_STATE 'Foo'
export __CV_PHONENUMBER '(+00)000 000 000'
export __CV_MAILADDRESS 'foo@bar.net'
```
